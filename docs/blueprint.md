## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#6660B2), evoking a sense of trust, intelligence, and security.
- Background color: Very light grayish-indigo (#F0F0F5). A desaturated, light tint of the primary, to maintain focus on content.
- Accent color: Purple (#947EC5), slightly lighter and more saturated than the primary, to draw the eye without distracting from it.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif typeface known for its readability and clean design, ensures the app is approachable and easy to use.
- Use minimalist, geometric icons that match the clean lines of the typeface.
- Maintain a clean and simple layout with an intuitive information architecture. Message threads should be chronologically ordered.
- Employ subtle transitions and animations to enhance user engagement, such as a fade-in effect upon new messages.
